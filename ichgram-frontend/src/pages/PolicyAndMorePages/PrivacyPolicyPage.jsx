                3. Sharing Your Data
                We do not sell your personal information.
                We may share your data:

                4. Your Rights
                Depending on your location, you may have rights such as:

                Accessing the personal data we hold about you

                Requesting correction or deletion of your data

                Withdrawing consent at any time

                Objecting to or limiting certain types of data use

                5. Data Retention
                We keep your data for as long as necessary to provide our services or as required by law. If you delete your account, your data will be removed or anonymized, unless legal obligations require otherwise.

                6. Security
                We use appropriate security measures to protect your personal data. However, no system is completely secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute protection.

                Our app is not intended for children under the age of 13 (or 16 in some regions). We do not knowingly collect personal data from children without parental consent.
